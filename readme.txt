== Description ==

The All in one demo Import/Export plugin allows you to export or import your WordPress customizer settings, Posts, pages, other custom post types, Comments
Custom fields, post meta, Categories, tags and terms from custom taxonomies and Authors from directly within the customizer interface! If your theme makes use of the WordPress customizer for its settings, this plugin is for you!

Please visit my website for more info on the [All in one demo Export/Import plugin](https://www.sanyog.in/wordpess-plugin/all-in-one-demo-import-export).


== How It Works ==

Exporting customizer settings is easy. Click the export button from within the customizer and a file will automatically begin downloading with your settings. Export files are named after your theme and can only be used to import settings for the theme or child theme that they came from. Export files contain a serialized dump of mods retrieved using the [get_theme_mods](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_theme_mods) function or customizer settings saved as options.

Importing customizer settings is just as easy. Choose the export file you would like to import, select whether you would like to download and import images (similar to importing posts), and finally, click the import button. Once your settings have been imported the page will refresh and your new design will be displayed.
